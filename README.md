## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

- Sensors are connected to the ESP32 which continuously reads:
  - Temperature & Humidity from DHT11
  - Pressure & Altitude from BMP280
  - Light intensity from LDR
  - Rain status from rain sensor
- The data is processed and shown on a 16x2 LCD using the I2C interface.
- A 12V adapter powers the system, regulated to 5V using the 7805 voltage regulator.
